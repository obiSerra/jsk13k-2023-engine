# jsk13k-2023-engine

The basic engine and pipeline I'll use for the 2023 js13kgames competition

## Why

I do not like using engines or frameworks made by others when participating to competitions like _js13kgames_ or similar; the fun part for me is making everything from scratch, re-inventing the wheel every time in a slightly different way :)

## What

This repo will not contain any specific game logic, only generic elements that are part of a "pre-made" engine.

So far this repo contains:

- a Game Loop class
- a Stage class (to handle HTML5 Canvas)
- a BaseEntity (game object) that will handle rendering, collision, etc...

## How

I wanted to use TypeScript and see if through compiling a could achieve a sufficient level of compression

## Then

When the official [js13kGames](https://js13kgames.com/) competition will start, I'll fork this repo and use it as the base for my entry
